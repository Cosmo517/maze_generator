# maze_generator
This is a maze generator/game. The user can choose the width/height of the maze, whether the starting position is random, goal position is random, and the 'difficulty'. The difficulty is a vision based system, with how far you can see around the player.

I still want to implement many things, such as multiple different algorthms to generate the maze, along with solving it.

Controls:
w - moves upward
a - move left
s - move down
d - move right
h - displays the full maze
p - solves the maze
q - quit
