# maze_generator
This is a maze generator/game. The user can choose the width/height of the maze, whether the starting position is random, goal position is random, and the 'difficulty'. The difficulty is a vision based system, with how far you can see around the player.

This was made for Windows and will (almost certainly) only run on windows. 

Use the setup.exe and MazeGameSetup.msi to install the game and play.

Controls:
- w - moves upward
- a - move left
- s - move down
- d - move right
- h - displays the full maze
- p - solves the maze
- q - quit
